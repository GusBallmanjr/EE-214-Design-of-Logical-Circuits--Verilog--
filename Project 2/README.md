Project 2:

This project is intended to teach how to use truth tables that describe the behavior of a digital circuit and convert it to a Product of Sums or a Sum of Products expression. For this preoject we were instructed not to minimize our expressions. For this porject I wrote the POS and SOP solutions using truth tables I was given and programmed it into verilog, I found switching was particularly easy and it showed me how to find a more efficent solution.
